# 🐢 Turtle Crossing the Road Game

A **Frogger-style crossing game** built using **Python Turtle graphics**, where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with moving cars.
With each successful crossing, the game increases in difficulty by speeding up the cars.

This project demonstrates **OOP concepts**, game loops, collision detection, and event-driven programming in Python.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

* Control the turtle using keyboard inputs
* Avoid oncoming cars
* Reach the finish line to level up
* Each level increases car speed
* Game ends upon collision

---

## ✨ Features

* 🐢 Player-controlled turtle character
* 🚗 Randomly generated moving cars
* 📈 Increasing difficulty with levels
* 🧠 Collision detection
* 🏁 Finish-line detection
* 🧾 Scoreboard with level tracking
* ❌ Game over screen

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Graphics:** Turtle module
* **Concepts Used:**

  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * Game loop
  * Event listeners (keyboard input)
  * Collision detection
  * Randomization

## 🧠 How the Game Works

* Cars spawn randomly from the right side of the screen
* Cars move left continuously
* Player reaches the top → level increases
* Each level increases car speed
* Collision with any car ends the game

---

## 🚧 Limitations

* No restart button
* No sound effects
* Fixed screen size
* Keyboard-only controls

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* 🔁 Restart / reset option
* 🔊 Add sound effects
* 🎨 Improved visuals and animations
* ⏱️ Timer or score-based system
* 🖱️ Mouse controls
* 🧪 Difficulty selection

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was built to:

* Practice **object-oriented programming**
* Understand **game mechanics**
* Learn **collision detection**
* Improve **logic structuring in Python**
* Build a **mid-level game project** for portfolio use
